# ASDP RULES — Before Planning or Editing (v1.0)

These steps MUST ALWAYS be followed before planning or editing.

- Read root `codespec.md`, `codetree.md`, `codemodel.md`.
- If the target folder is known, also read that folder’s `codespec.md` and `codemodel.md`.
- If documentation and code appear misaligned or required docs are missing, stop and correct documentation before planning, following `~/.asdp/core/spec/codespec.md`, `~/.asdp/core/spec/codemodel.md`, `~/.asdp/core/spec/codetree.md`; invoke skill `asdp-doc-rebuilder`.
- Do not start until you fully understand module role, APIs, structure, and dependencies.
